            <h2>Former Knicks guard Ron Baker retires </h2>
            <h3>Dan Feldman</h3>
            <p> Ron Baker made the Knicks as an undrafted free agent out of Wichita State in 2016, impressed as a hustle player then secured a two-year contract worth nearly $9 million on the first day of 2017 free agency. He fell from the NBA before the end of that deal.Now, he’s out of basketball entirely.</p>
            <h2>Oscar Robertson: With triple-double average, Russell Westbrook should’ve won 2021 NBA MVP</h2>
            <h3>Dan Feldman</h3>
            <p>I thought Russell Westbrook deserved 2017 NBA MVP. His singular ability lifted the Thunder to respectability despite a limited supporting cast. He took on a massive offensive role, tearing through tight spacing to create relatively efficient shots for himself and others. That allowed Oklahoma City to play better defenders around him. His clutch play was phenomenal, turning numerous games in the Thunder’s favor.</p>

            <p> Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City President Esther George is still advocating for the central bank to slow its stimulus starting next month, despite the rising cases of the Delta variant.

            <h2>Billie Jean King: A ‘dream’ watching Naomi Osaka and Simone Biles speak out</h2>
            <h3>Max Zahn with Andy Serwer</h3>
            <p>When the U.S. Open begins on Monday, women's tennis star Naomi Osaka will draw the world's attention — both for how she'll play and what she might say. The tour's third-ranked player wore COVID-19 masks at last year's tournament that featured the names of Black victims of police violence, and she quit the French Open in May with an explanation on Instagram about her mental health struggles that has garnered more than 865,000 likes.Osaka can count on support from one of the sport's legends, Billie Jean King, who in a recent interview with Yahoo Finance praised outspoken young athletes like Osaka and gymnast Simon Biles. A prominent advocate for pay equity during her playing career, King said top athletes today can build an even bigger platform due to the emergence of social media.</p>

            <h3>Lyndsey Parker</h3>
            <p> When Police Academy star Michael Winslow resurfaced on America’s Got Talent earlier this season, he was probably the most famous person to ever try out for the show. Host Terry Crews gushingly called him a “legend,” Howie Mandel called him a “trailblazer,” and Simon Cowell said he was “thrilled” to see the 62-year-old self-described “voicetramentalist” back onstage. </p>

            <h3>Yahoo Entertainment Staff</h3>
            <p>It took lots of new-fashioned digital magic to make Disney's old-fashioned period adventure Jungle Cruise. For evidence, check out this exclusive pre-VFX deleted scene from the Jaume Collet-Serra-directed film, which pairs Dwayne Johnson and Emily Blunt as odd-couple explorers who embark on a perilous mission along the Amazon River. Along the way, this bickering duo (who are equally adept at bickering in real life) discovers new dangers, new allies... and a newfound attraction to each other.</p>
